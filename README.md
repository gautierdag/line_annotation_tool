# Data_Annotation

This is a Tkinter implementation of a simple line labeling tool. To be used for the purpose of labeling lines in images (to be used for labeling lines of a robocup soccer field).

## Getting Started

The output folder is `./labels/` .

Create an `imgs/` folder and place images in it to be able to label them. The images should be in the same format that they were collected - plaatje612 or plaatjeBOTTOM612 (where 612 is the img number). See this download link to obtain the images folder: [Download imgs folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1csiuPxYe1llTvbh0SZsPpoYEfwURZ7c9?usp=sharing)

You can start the program by running `python main.py` in your terminal after accessing the directory.

This was tested on MAC OS with python3.6
You might need to pip install some modules:

```

```
```

```

Uses other standard packages such as: glob, csv, pickle, copy and os.
